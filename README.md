# Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis using Descriptive Statistics

## Introduction
This project analyzes customer purchasing behavior using descriptive statistics to provide insights into patterns, trends, and correlations. The analysis aims to help a company optimize its marketing efforts and increase offer acceptance rates.

## Project Overview
The project involves the following key tasks:
1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculation of measures of central tendency and dispersion for key variables, and handling outliers.
2. **Probability Distributions**: Identification of suitable probability distributions for variables, and calculation of probabilities and expected values.
3. **Insights and Customer Segmentation**: Exploration of relationships between customer characteristics and spending habits, and segmentation of customers based on their behaviors.
4. **Conclusion and Recommendations**: Visualization of findings and provision of actionable recommendations based on the analysis.

## Evaluation Metrics
The project employs various statistical measures to evaluate the dataset:
- **Central Tendency**: Mean, median, and mode.
- **Dispersion**: Variance and standard deviation.
- **Probability Distributions**: Identification of variables following specific distributions such as Binomial or Normal, and calculation of corresponding probabilities.

## Results
### Descriptive Statistics
- **Income**: 
  - Mean: $52,356
  - Median: $51,500
  - Standard Deviation: $18,738
- **Age**: 
  - Mean: 47 years
  - Median: 48 years
  - Standard Deviation: 7 years
- **Total Spending** (on various products in the last 2 years):
  - Mean: $722
  - Median: $600
  - Standard Deviation: $500

### Probability Distributions
- **Income Distribution**: Follows a normal distribution with a mean of $52,356 and a standard deviation of $18,738.
- **Acceptance Probability**: Probability of a customer accepting the offer is calculated using the binomial distribution, with an observed acceptance rate of 13%.

### Customer Segmentation
- **Segment 1**: High-income, low-complaint customers with high spending on wines and meats.
- **Segment 2**: Middle-income families with kids, moderate spending on all product categories.
- **Segment 3**: Low-income, high-complaint customers with minimal spending.

## Feature Importance
The dataset includes the following features:
- **Response**: Target variable indicating if the customer accepted the offer (1: Yes, 0: No).
- **ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Year_Birth**: Customer's birth year.
- **Complain**: Indicator if the customer complained in the last 2 years.
- **Dt_Customer**: Date of customer's enrollment.
- **Education**: Customer's education level.
- **Marital**: Marital status.
- **Kidhome**: Number of small children in the household.
- **Teenhome**: Number of teenagers in the household.
- **Income**: Yearly household income.
- **MntFishProducts**: Amount spent on fish products in the last 2 years.
- **MntMeatProducts**: Amount spent on meat products in the last 2 years.
- **MntFruits**: Amount spent on fruit products in the last 2 years.
- **MntSweetProducts**: Amount spent on sweet products in the last 2 years.
- **MntWines**: Amount spent on wines in the last 2 years.
- **NumDealsPurchases**: Number of purchases made with a discount.
- **NumWebPurchases**: Number of purchases made through the company's website.
- **NumCatalogPurchases**: Number of purchases made using a catalog.
- **NumStorePurchases**: Number of purchases made directly in stores.
- **NumWebVisitsMonth**: Number of website visits in the last month.

## Summary
The analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior, revealing key patterns and trends. For instance, high-income customers tend to spend more on wines and meats, whereas low-income customers have higher complaint rates and lower spending.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the application of descriptive statistics and probability theory to real-world data. The findings and recommendations, such as targeting high-income customers with premium offers and addressing complaints more effectively, can help the company enhance its marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.
